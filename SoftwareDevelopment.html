    <div class="para"><p>Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and
            bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software
            development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that
            is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software,
            sometimes in a planned and structured process.[1] Therefore, software development may include research, new
            development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in
            software products.

The software can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being to meet specific needs of a specific
client/business (the case with custom software), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential users
(the case with commercial and open source software), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist may write
software to automate a mundane task). Embedded software development, that is, the development of embedded software,
such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the development process to be integrated with the development of
the controlled physical product. System software underlies applications and the programming process itself, and is often
developed separately. </p></div>
